<h4>On Siafu</h4>
<ul>
  <li><p><a name="whatis"></a>What is Siafu?</p>
  <p>An african <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siafu" target="_blank">ant</a>. Ok, seriously, Siafu is a versatile, large-scale Context Simulator written in Java. Download it, create or modify a scenario and fire it up. Your simulated world includes models for agents, places and the context therein. By tweaking these models, you influence the scenario, and can collect the context data for any of your agents.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><a name="doc"></a>What's the available documentation?</p>
    <p>Start with <a href="{{ site.root_url }}/tutorial" target="_blank">tutorial</a>. Another
      helpful introduction would be the <a href="http://miquelmartin.org/?what=pubs#siafupub" target="_blank">paper
      and poster</a> published together with Petteri Nurmi. Finally, there's
      always the <a href="{{ site.root_url }}/javadoc" target="_blank">Javadoc</a>. We've tried to make it as consistent and complete as
      possible! Also, keep an eye at the <a href="{{ site.root_url }}/developers" target="_blank"/>developers page</a></p>
  </li>
  <li><a name="pub"></a>Any publications available?
    <p>Definitelly! Check out <a href="http://miquelmartin.org/?what=pubs#siafupub" target="_blank">A large scale simulator for ubiquitous computing</a> by <a href="http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ptnurmi/"  target="_blank">Petteri Nurmi</a> and myself, <a href="http://miquelmartin.org">Miquel Martin</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>License issues:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><a name="lic"></a>What is the license of Siafu? And the simulations?
    <p>NEC Europe Ltd. releases Siafu under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.txt" target="_blank">GPL</a> license. The simulations are a derivative work of Siafu, and therefore are also <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.txt" target="_blank">GPL</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li><a name="simlic"></a>Will my Simulations also be GPL?
    <p>Yes. Simulations are based on Siafu, and are therefore a derivative work.
      Your simulations will therefore be GPL. Note that this has no effect if
      you keep the simulation to yourself. For more details, check the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.txt" target="_blank">GPL text</a>. Also I found <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html" target="_blank">this FAQ</a> very helpful.</p>
  </li>
  <li><a name="viralgpl"></a>If I connect Siafu to my project, does it become GPL?
    <p>No. However read the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.txt" target="_blank">GPL text</a> for the authoritative answer.</p>
    <p>So, this is how we see it: if you extend Siafu, your extension is GPL.
      If you make simulations, they are GPL too. If you develop an independent
      project which uses Siafu as a simulation tool, data generation, etc..,
      then <strong>no</strong>, your project does not become GPL. There's one
      exception, and that is, if your project builds tightly around Siafu itself,
      and woudln't work without it. In most cases you pick up data from Siafu
      for lack of a real sensor, and tehrefore, GPL doesn't propagate to your
      project. In any case, if in doubt, <a href="{{ site.root_url }}/contact" target="_blank">talk</a> to
      us. We're all nice and reasonable!

<h4>Functionality and participation</h4>
<ul>
  <li><a name="wishlist"></a>I wish Siafu could do...
    <p>I (Miquel Martin) have been developing Siafu to the current status. I
      will continue to participate in the project, and I will try to build it
      up further, but do remember: this is now an Open Source project. If you
      can, participate! Your help is very welcome. Please use the forums to ask
      for specific funcionality details. We'll try and keep a wishlist there
      too, so we can prioritize what we do next. 
  </li>
  <li><a name="participate"></a>I'd like to help!
    <p>Awesome! Please do! Join the project. Researchers, coders, artists, I'm
      sure we can find someplace you can help. Join the forums, talk to <a href="{{ site.root_url }}/contact" target="_blank">us</a>,
      and don't leave it for tomorrow!
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Other issues</h4>
<ul>
  <li><a name="H2G2"></a>What about the ultimate Question about Life, the Universe,
      and Everything else?
  <p>The answer is, of course, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Answer_to_Life,_the_Universe,_and_Everything" target="_blank">42</a>. If you Frequently Ask yourself any other Question, drop <a href="{{ site.root_url }}/contact">us</a> a line or open a new Issue</p>
