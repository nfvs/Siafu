  <h1>So, what is Siafu?</h1>
<p>Siafu is a versatile, large-scale Context Simulator written in Java. Download it, create or modify a scenario and fire it up. Your simulated world includes models for agents, places and the context therein. By tweaking these models, you influence the scenario, and can collect the context data for any of your agents.
</p>
    
<h1>Fine, what do I do with it?</h1>
<p>Glad you asked! Essentially: visualize your context information, generate datasets for machine learning, test and demonstrate your applications. Check this:</p>
<img src="{{ site.root_url }}/images/usage.gif" alt="Using Siafu: test, demo, visualize and generate datasets" height="196" width="565" />
<p>Siafu can generate its own context and at the same time incorporate the one you obtain from your sensors. The information can then be visualized with a user interface, or you can generate datasets for machine learning. By plugging an application to it, you can test and demonstrate the effects of context changes on it.
<p>Grab Siafu <a href="{{ site.root_url }}/download">here</a>, get one of the existing <a href="{{ site.root_url }}/simulations">Simulations</a> or create your own using this <a href="{{ site.root_url }}/tutorial">tutorial</a>. Siafu is released under the GPL license, enjoy and tell us how it worked out!</p>
<p>Remember, this is an open source project, you are very welcome to contribute to Siafu, publish your simulation, or give us a link to whatever it is you used it for!</p>

<p>Existing simulations are large as a city, small as an office and any anything in between. Simulated context includes user preferences, proximity information, position, hotspot coverage and well, really, anything you care to simulate.</p>

<h1>A bit of history and acknowledgements</h1>

<p>Siafu was originally developed by <a href="http://miquelmartin.org">Miquel Martin</a> working at the <a href="http://neclab.eu/" title="NEC">NEC European Research Lab</a> within the <a href="http://www.ist-mobilife.org/">MobiLife</a> project and as such, was partly funded by the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a>. <a href="https://github.com/nfvs">Nuno Santos</a> contributed the port of this page to jekyll and therefore github, mavenized the project and is actively contributing improvements to the simulator itself.</p>

<p>The idea for the simulator came up in discussions with Miquel, <a href="http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ptnurmi/" title="Petteri Nurmi">Petteri Nurmi</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/floreen/">Patrik Flor&eacute;en</a>. At the time, the objective was to discover groups of users, even if the users themselves were not aware of their commonoalities. A simulation was required to generate appropriate data sets, and Siafu, with the <a href="{{ site.root_url }}/simulations/leimen">Leimen</a> simulation came out of it. Miquel and Petteri later presented a <a href="http://miquelmartin.org/?what=pubs#siafupub">poster</a> about Siafu in <a title="Mobiquitous 2006" href="http://www.mobiquitous.org/2006/">MobiQuitous 2006</a>. In July 2007, <a href="http://www.netlab.nec.de/" title="NEC">NEC</a> open sourced the project, and Siafu release 1.0 was given to the comunity under the GPL license.</p>
